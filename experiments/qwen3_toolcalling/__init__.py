Qwen3-4B MLX + FluxEM Tool Calling Benchmark.

This package implements a tool-calling system where Qwen3-4B (running on MLX
for Apple Silicon) uses FluxEM's 11 deterministic domain tools.

The goal is to demonstrate that LLM + deterministic tools >> LLM learning
embeddings alone across scientific and mathematical domains.
